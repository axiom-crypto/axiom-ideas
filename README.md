# Axiom Idea Library

Axiom allows smart contracts on Ethereum to trustlessly access and compute over the entire history of Ethereum.  Developers can query any piece of historic on-chain data via Axiom, including transactions and receipts. Axiom trustlessly returns ZK-verified results on-chain via a callback to developers' smart contract.
