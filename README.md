# Axiom Idea Library
Axiom is the first ZK coprocessor scaling data-rich applications on Ethereum which provides smart contracts trustless access to all on-chain data and arbitrary expressive computing over it. For the first time, developers can build rich on-chain applications without imposing additional trust assumptions.
Developers query historic data from Ethereum via Axiom, and Axiom trustlessly fulfills ZK-verified results on-chain. Developers can then operate on the results in their smart contracts, enabling a new class of data-rich applications.

## Workflow
Here you will find a library of ideas that have been built or can be built on Axiom. Feel free to read through them for inspiration and explore the topics you are interested in. 

If you would like to work on any ideas listed here or propose your own, feel free to directly reach out to the team ([Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4nDgMUq7Ra)). We will work out a proposal together to ensure that you can successfully build out the ideas.
