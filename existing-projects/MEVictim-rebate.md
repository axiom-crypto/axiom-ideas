## Summary
This project identifies victims of MEV attacks on ETH Goerli and grants these victims an ERC-721 token that qualifies the holder to access a token-gated Uniswap v4 pool on Scroll.

## Axiomâ€™s involvement
Axiom proves that an address is indeed the victim in a frontrunning MEV attack and verifies the proof onchain to trigger airdrop. 

## Outcome
