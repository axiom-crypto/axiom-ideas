## Summary
A template for projects to airdrop to qualified users. 

## Axiom's Involvement
 Users utilize a data-fetching layer on top of Axiom to autonomously prove that their account matches some parameters before submitting a Query. In this case, it is the user who has used Uniswap (swapping a token for a token that is not ETH) on the Goerli testnet after block 9000000.

 ## Outcome
https://github.com/axiom-crypto/autonomous-airdrop-example
