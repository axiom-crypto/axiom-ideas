## Summary
Provable social graph is a smart contract that measures and proves relationships between addresses. The smart contract indexes addresses’ onchain activities and find common ground between them. The common ground can be that they have all owned the same NFTs before or they have all interacted a protocol before a certain date. The social graph helps addresses figure out these relationships. 

## Axiom’s involvement
The social graph smart contract can submit the data queries on multiple addresses to Axiom. The result is tied back to a callback address that can be a user of the social graph or other smart contracts. 
A more advanced iteration of the social graph would standarize the evaluation of relationships and write the evaluation framework into a circuit to be computed offchain.
